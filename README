I. BRIEF DESCRIPTION

	IPv6 Services Monitoring Tool (IPV6-SMT) is a tool that monitors http, dns and smtp services and checks whether these services are available over IPv6. IPv6-SMT queries a given list of domain names and check for AAAA, NS and MX records. There are 3 different states defined for a service namely: 
	- No IPv6 address assigned.
	- IPv6 address assigned but there is no response to the requests over IPv6.
	- Service fully supports IPv6.

II. RELEASE INFO

	v0.1
	- First release of the script.
	- Tested on Ubuntu 12.04.
	- New feature: data_collector.php can only be run over CLI.


III. REQUIREMENTS
	
	- Apache/2.2.22
	- PHP 5.3.10 or later.
	- nagios-plugins package.


IV. INSTALLATION & CONFIGURATION

	You should have global IPv6 connection in your machine in order to use IPv6-SMT.	
	PHP and nagios-plugins package should be installed at the system.
	As the second step you should take a look at the config.json file to set the paths for data directory, input file and nagios-plugins scripts. 
	You may configure debug mode as 1 if you like to see the details of what is being done.
	Next step will be running the data_collector.php script on the command line. This script will collect all the necessary information and write them under the data directory in the json format.
	Data collection may be added to the cron using the example below:

	Crontab example line:
		
		# m h dom mon dow user  command
		15 3    * * *   www-data    /usr/bin/php [exact_path]/data_collector.php
	
	When the data collection phase is completed, ipv6_smt.php will be executed through a browser. This script will read the collected data under domains directory and will show the domain service status report on the browser.
	
	Data files will be automatically created by reading input file under data directory. Names will be in the format domains_dd-mm-yyyy.json and count_dd-mm-yyyy.json .
	
	Select date list is created automatically by checking the domains_dd-mm-yyyy.json files under the data directory. If domains_dd-mm-yyyy.json file is smaller than 100b, it will not be listed in the select date list.
